# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) – C# .NET

## Overview
This project implements a solution to find the **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** from a sequence of integers provided as a single space-separated string.

If more than one increasing subsequence exists with the same maximum length, the **earliest occurring subsequence** is returned.

The solution is written in **C# .NET**, follows clean coding practices, and includes **unit tests using xUnit**.

## Problem Statement
Given a string of integers separated by single whitespace, determine the longest increasing subsequence (not necessarily consecutive).

### Example

**Input**
6 1 5 9 2

**Output**
1 5 9
